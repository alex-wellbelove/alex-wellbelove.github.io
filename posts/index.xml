      <description>Dependent types have a reputation.
When you read about them, you will hear that they are &amp;lsquo;a programming language feature so advanced that they can be used as a foundation of all of mathematics&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;that you need a PhD to use, let alone to understand, any language that has dependent types&amp;rsquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;m continuing a tradition1 here by saying that they are actually simpler to understand than most type systems.</description>

      <description>When talking about &amp;#39;saving&amp;#39;, I think a lot of people put it into the &amp;#39;necessary evil&amp;#39; bucket. Something to be ashamed you&amp;#39;re not quite doing enough of, or something that you&amp;#39;re putting off a month or two. Something like a New Year&amp;#39;s resolution to exercise more.
But, in the same way that, depending on your outlook, exercise can be treadmill drudgery or a life-affirming hobby, I believe frugality can be in and of itself a source of happiness - without considering the financial benefits.</description>
