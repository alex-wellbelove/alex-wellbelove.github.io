<h1 class="post-title">Cheapness</h1>
    
    <time>April 12, 2020</time>

        <p>
        <p>
When talking about &#39;saving&#39;, I think a lot of people put it into the &#39;necessary evil&#39; bucket. Something to be ashamed you&#39;re not quite doing enough of, or something that you&#39;re putting off a month or two. Something like a New Year&#39;s resolution to exercise more.</p>
<p>
But, in the same way that, depending on your outlook, exercise can be treadmill drudgery or a life-affirming hobby, I believe frugality can be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in and of itself</span> a source of happiness - without considering the financial benefits.</p>
<p>
That is to say, given two options, one expensive and one cheap, I believe you should usually choose the cheaper option, whatever your financial situation.</p>
<p>
This is obviously a strong statement to make, so let me give a few examples of situations in which frugality leads directly to a better life; without considering the obvious benefits of peace of mind, etc. Afterwards, I&#39;ll write a few thoughts on why I think this is the case, as well as some more unusual benefits of frugality.</p>
<p>
As a first example, consider the bicycle. Given the choice between a car and a bicycle, the &#39;choose cheap&#39; heuristic points you towards the bicycle. 
I submit that riding a bicycle is simply more enjoyable and more beneficial to your state of mind than a car. Even it if were more expensive to do so, you should choose the bicycle.</p>
<p>
Secondly, food. Eating expensively for most probably means some combination of takeout, fast food, snacks and alcohol. Using the &#39;cheapness&#39; heuristic points you instead to vegetables, home cooked meals, and reducing alcohol intake.
It&#39;s hard to argue that the second won&#39;t lead to an overall increase in your happiness.</p>
<p>
Other mishmashed cheapnesses - library over Netflix, a small wardrobe of loved items over a large anonymous one, avoiding the commute, avoiding overly-touristed destinations etc.</p>
<p>
This doesn&#39;t apply in totality to everything of course, I&#39;m not suggesting instant ramen and a mattress on the floor, but the things it does apply to share some commonalities.</p>
<p>
Your &#39;short-term&#39;, emotional brain (think drunk) doesn&#39;t consider either the future consequences of your activities, or their future benefits. When you buy fast food, you are not thinking of how you will feel after you eat it, or in the morning. You are also not thinking, when you spend money, of how depleted your bank account will be and of how you may have to cut back on things you truly love. </p>
<p>
You are in the same place mentally when you are being profligate and when you are being short-sighted and self-destructive, almost by definition. </p>
<p>
Use frugality as a way to keep yourself focused on the things that increase your happiness.</p>
